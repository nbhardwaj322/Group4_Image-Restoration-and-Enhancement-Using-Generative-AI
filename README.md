# Group4_Image-Restoration-and-Enhancement-Using-Generative-AI
This project develops an integrated image restoration and enhancement system that  leverages pretrained generative models from Hugging Face to perform four critical  image processing tasks: denoising, super-resolution, colorization, and inpainting

Four core tasks using Hugging Face pretrained models:

Denoising (Stable Diffusion img2img)

Super-Resolution (ESRGAN 4x upscaling)

Colorization (Stable Diffusion img2img)

Inpainting (Stable Diffusion Inpainting)

Quantitative Results (Beans Dataset, 128 images):

Task	PSNR (dB)	SSIM
Denoising	10.20	0.074
Super-Resolution	19.67	0.400
